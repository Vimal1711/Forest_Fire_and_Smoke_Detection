# 🔥 Forest Fire Detection Using CNNs
# 🌍 Project Overview
Forest fires pose a significant threat to the environment, wildlife, human life, and the global economy. With the increasing frequency of wildfires — such as the devastating incidents in Australia, Southern Europe, and North Africa — early and accurate fire detection has become more crucial than ever.

Forests, as the world’s largest land-based ecosystem, are key to climate regulation, soil preservation, and water cycle stability. This project focuses on leveraging deep learning techniques to detect forest fires at an early stage through image analysis, aiming to support rapid response and mitigation efforts.

# 🧠 Objective
-> To develop and evaluate CNN-based models for early forest fire detection by:

-> Reviewing traditional vs. deep learning approaches.

-> Implementing image-based smoke/fire detection models using CNNs.

-> Comparing model performances on various metrics.

-> Highlighting real-world challenges and proposing potential solutions.

# 🔍 Methodology
Dataset Preparation

Two unique pre-processed datasets were used:

-> Augmented Data: Increased dataset size using transformations (rotation, scaling, flipping, etc.)

-> Corrected Data + CLAHE: Enhanced image contrast using Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE)

Models Implemented

-> VGG16

-> VGG19

-> ResNet50


# 📊 Key Results
-> The performance of models varied based on dataset type and complexity.

-> Comparative analysis highlighted trade-offs between detection accuracy and computational cost.

-> CNNs outperformed traditional feature extraction and manual classification techniques.

-> CLAHE-processed datasets led to better contrast handling, improving detection in low-visibility conditions.

# ⚖️ Challenges
-> Manual smoke detection is inefficient and error-prone.

-> Variations in smoke color, shape, and texture complicate automated detection.

-> Thermal/infrared detection systems are expensive and impractical for wide deployment.

-> Many detection systems suffer from false alarms due to poor feature extraction and noise.
